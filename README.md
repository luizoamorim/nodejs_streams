# PROJECT

The goal of this project is read csv files from dataset dir and concat it in another file.

For it I've used libs like: stream, fs and stream-concat.

# NODEJS STREAMS

The nodejs stream library allow us to work with large amounts of data under demand. The data is divided in small chunks of data. So is possible process media or big data in way that the ram memory can do.


## Testing 

Do the download of 2 or more csv files and save them in dataset dir. 
After ir run:
```
npm start
```
